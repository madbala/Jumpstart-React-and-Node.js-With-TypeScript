# Styled Components

Once we complete task 1, we have a very basic React component without any style.

We are going to apply some styles using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

## Task 1: Setup & Use Styled Components

Install `styled-components`. Using styled-components, apply **red** color to header by creating a `<Header/>` element. Here is how it looks like:

![Red header](assets/red-header.png)

## Task 2: Media Queries

Right now, the header size is same for both desktops and mobile devices. We need a smaller size of **24px** for Header in mobile devices with width upto **480px**. Also, change the color to green just for us to understand that the mobile style is applied. Implement that using media query.

## Task 3: Extending Components

We are going to create a Hero element. Hero element refers to a block with very large text. Since a Hero element is also created using `h1` tag, we can extend our `Header` element to create `Hero` element. After extending, apply **blue** color and a font size of **100px**.

Add the `<Hero>` element to component before `<Header>` to see how it works. This is how the current component looks like:

```html
<div>
  <Hero>I am a hero</Hero>
  <header>Hello React!</header>
</div>
```
